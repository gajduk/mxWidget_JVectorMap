##Making modifications to the widget

[In order to make changes to the widget you need to get familiar with custom widget development for Mendix. This is a good place to start https://docs.mendix.com/howto50/creating-a-basic-hello-world-custom-widget](https://docs.mendix.com/howto50/creating-a-basic-hello-world-custom-widget). 

Make sure to have Node.js installed [https://nodejs.org/en/download/](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (I have version 6.9.1 , not sure which other versions work).
Then I suggest to install grunt (this automates building and delpoying the widget while you are working on it) [https://gruntjs.com/](https://gruntjs.com/) (I have grunt-cli v1.2.0 and grunt v1.0.1).

Once you clone the repository run 
``
npm install
``

## Typical usage scenario

This widget is still in development.
